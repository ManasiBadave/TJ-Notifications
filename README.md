# TJ Notifications
TJ Notifications is an extremely powerful and flexible notifications system for Joomla. Currently, supports sending notifications by email but we are planning to supports SMS, push notifications and in-site notifications. Users can also set their preferences to stop receiving certain types of notifications, or change delivery preferences. 

Joomla Developers are encouraged to use this to offer better control as well as variety in delivery modes
